# Voxel Coding

**Voxel Coding** is a learning environment designed to help learners develop computational and spatial thinking.

Learners explore a dynamically generated `3D voxel-based` world and use `Blockly` to build structures and automate tasks through visual programming.

`Voxel Coding` serves as a creative playground where users can experiment with logic, geometry, and automation in an exploratory virtual space.
